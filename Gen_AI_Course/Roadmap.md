### Word Embedding Techniques

Word embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words to be represented as vectors in a continuous vector space. These vectors capture semantic meaning, making them essential for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Here, we'll explore four popular word embedding techniques: Word2Vec, GloVe, ELMO, and FastText.

#### 1. Word2Vec
- **Overview**: Developed by Google, Word2Vec uses shallow neural networks to learn word representations. It comes in two flavors: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-Gram.
  - **CBOW**: Predicts the target word given context words.
  - **Skip-Gram**: Predicts context words given a target word.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Training Objective**: Maximize the probability of context words given a target word (Skip-Gram) or target word given context words (CBOW).
  - **Embedding Dimension**: Typically between 100 and 300 dimensions.
  
- **Example Code (using Gensim)**:
  ```python
  from gensim.models import Word2Vec
  
  # Sample data
  sentences = [["I", "love", "deep", "learning"], ["deep", "learning", "is", "fun"]]

  # Training Word2Vec model
  model = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, sg=1)  # sg=1 for Skip-Gram

  # Get vector for a word
  vector = model.wv['deep']
  ```

#### 2. GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)
- **Overview**: Developed by Stanford, GloVe focuses on the global context by aggregating word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus.
  - **Training Objective**: Minimizes the difference between the dot product of word vectors and the logarithm of their probability of co-occurrence.
  
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Co-occurrence Matrix**: Counts how often words appear together within a certain context window.
  - **Embedding Dimension**: Typically between 100 and 300 dimensions.
  
- **Example Code (using GloVe Pre-trained vectors)**:
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  
  # Load pre-trained GloVe vectors
  glove_vectors = {}
  with open("glove.6B.100d.txt", "r") as f:
      for line in f:
          values = line.split()
          word = values[0]
          vector = np.asarray(values[1:], "float32")
          glove_vectors[word] = vector
  
  # Get vector for a word
  vector = glove_vectors['deep']
  ```

#### 3. ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models)
- **Overview**: Developed by Allen Institute for AI, ELMo generates deep contextualized word representations. Unlike static embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe, ELMo embeddings are context-sensitive and generated from a bidirectional LSTM trained on a language modeling task.
  
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Contextual Embeddings**: Words have different embeddings depending on their context.
  - **Layered Representations**: Uses representations from multiple layers of the neural network.

- **Example Code (using TensorFlow Hub)**:
  ```python
  import tensorflow_hub as hub
  import tensorflow as tf

  # Load ELMo model from TensorFlow Hub
  elmo = hub.load("https://tfhub.dev/google/elmo/3")

  # Sample sentence
  sentence = ["I love deep learning"]

  # Generate embeddings
  embeddings = elmo.signatures["default"](tf.constant(sentence))["elmo"]
  ```

#### 4. FastText
- **Overview**: Developed by Facebook, FastText extends Word2Vec by considering subword information, making it robust to out-of-vocabulary words.
  - **Training Objective**: Similar to Word2Vec's Skip-Gram, but includes subword (character n-gram) information in the training.
  
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Subword Information**: Considers parts of words (n-grams), improving handling of rare and misspelled words.
  - **Embedding Dimension**: Typically between 100 and 300 dimensions.

- **Example Code (using Gensim)**:
  ```python
  from gensim.models import FastText
  
  # Sample data
  sentences = [["I", "love", "deep", "learning"], ["deep", "learning", "is", "fun"]]

  # Training FastText model
  model = FastText(sentences, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1)

  # Get vector for a word
  vector = model.wv['deep']
  ```

### Conclusion

Each word embedding technique has its strengths and use cases:

- **Word2Vec**: Effective for capturing word meanings and relationships based on context.
- **GloVe**: Utilizes global word co-occurrence statistics to produce meaningful embeddings.
- **ELMo**: Provides deep contextualized word representations suitable for tasks requiring understanding of word usage in different contexts.
- **FastText**: Handles out-of-vocabulary words and rare words by considering subword information.

Understanding and applying these techniques will significantly enhance your ability to process and analyze textual data in various NLP tasks.

          self.b = self.add_weight(name='att_bias', shape=(input_shape[-1],),
                                   initializer='zeros', trainable=True)
          super(Attention, self).build(input_shape)

      def call(self, x):
          e = tf.keras.backend.tanh(tf.keras.backend.dot(x, self.W) + self.b)
          a = tf.keras.backend.softmax(e, axis=1)
          output = x * a
          return tf.keras.backend.sum(output, axis=1)

  # Add Attention layer in a model
  sequence_input = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(100, 128))
  attention_output = Attention()(sequence_input)
  output = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(attention_output)
  model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=sequence_input, outputs=output)
  ```

              nn.ReLU(),
              nn.Linear(ff_dim, embed_dim),
          )
          self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

      def forward(self, x):
          attn_output, _ = self.attention(x, x, x)
          x = self.norm1(x + attn_output)
          ff_output = self.ff(x)
          x = self.norm2(x + self.dropout(ff_output))
          return x

  # Using the Transformer block
  sample_input = torch.rand(10, 32, 512)  # (sequence_length, batch_size, embed_dim)
  transformer_block = TransformerBlock(embed_dim=512, num_heads=8, ff_dim=2048)
  output = transformer_block(sample_input)
  ```
